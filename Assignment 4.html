              <h2>What is new media?</h2>
              <p>
                To start, new media is not entirely a revolutionary concept. It builds upon and reworks conventions of visual, cinematic, and media culture from past centuries.

              <h2>Numerical representation</h2>
              <p>
                First off, numerical representation in new media consists of objects that are made of digital code, which can be manipulated algorithmically.

              <h2>Modularity</h2>
              <p>
                Modularity would consist of re-usable objects, typically smaller independent objects that can be recombined to create something entirely new.

                <h2>Automation</h2>
                <p>
                    Automation has been key in increasing the efficiency of how content is being put out by creatives and more. The existence of apps capable of editing and changing the way content can be viewed has been crucial to the output of content and media.

                <h2>Variability</h2>
                <p>
                    Variability in new media content leads to more variation of content that would seem repetitive to many had there not been subjective interpretations and input as to what can be changed. This applies to personalization such as a website

                <p>
                    Transcoding, digital data can only influence so much without the input of creative minds consisting of cultural and human interactions.

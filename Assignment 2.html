            The internet is a complex system, one that requires more than just satellites or computers to power and showcase anything for anyone to see. The infrastructure needed to maintain and continue building on consists of many components such as underwater cables that power the global internet. Privacy is always at risk once something is exposed to the internet. Other countries are more than capable of suppressing and changing what a viewer would see in their country.
